import pandas as pd
homelessness = pd.read_csv('homelessness.csv')

# Print the head of the homelessness data
print(homelessness.head())

# Print information about homelessness
print(homelessness.info())

# Print the shape of homelessness
print(homelessness.shape)

# Print a description of homelessness
print(homelessness.describe())

# Print the values of homelessness
print(homelessness.values)

# Print the column index of homelessness
print(homelessness.columns)

# Print the row index of homelessness
print(homelessness.index)

### Sorting the rows of DF by the values in specific column(s):
# Sort homelessness by individuals
homelessness_ind = homelessness.sort_values("individuals")

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_ind.head())

# Sort homelessness by descending family members
homelessness_fam = homelessness.sort_values('family_members', ascending=False)

print(homelessness_fam.head())

# Sort homelessness by region, then descending family members
homelessness_reg_fam = homelessness.sort_values(['region', 'family_members'], ascending=[True, False])

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_reg_fam.head())

### Subsetting columns
# Select the individuals column
individuals = homelessness['individuals']

print(individuals.head())

# Select the state and family_members columns
state_fam = homelessness[['state', 'family_members']]

print(state_fam.head())

# Select only the individuals and state columns, in that order
ind_state = homelessness[['individuals', 'state']]

print(ind_state.head())

### Subsetting rows
# Filter for rows where individuals is greater than 10000
ind_gt_10k = homelessness[homelessness['individuals'] > 10000]

# See the result
print(ind_gt_10k)

# Filter for rows where region is Mountain
mountain_reg = homelessness[homelessness['region'] == 'Mountain']

# See the result
print(mountain_reg)

# Filter for rows where family_members is less than 1000 
# and region is Pacific
fam_lt_1k_pac = homelessness[(homelessness['family_members'] < 1000) & (homelessness['region'] == 'Pacific')]

# See the result
print(fam_lt_1k_pac)

# Filter for rows in the Mojave Desert states
    # The Mojave Desert states
canu = ["California", "Arizona", "Nevada", "Utah"]
mojave_homelessness = homelessness[homelessness['state'].isin(canu)]

# See the result
print(mojave_homelessness)

### Adding columns to the DF
# Add total col as sum of individuals and family_members
homelessness['total'] = homelessness['individuals'] + homelessness['family_members']

# Add p_homeless col as proportion of total homeless population to the state population
homelessness['p_homeless'] = homelessness['total'] / homelessness['state_pop']

# See the result
print(homelessness)

### Answering questions using our data!
###############
# EX: In 2018, which state had the highest number of homeless individuals per 10,000 people in the state?
#######
# Create indiv_per_10k col as homeless individuals per 10k state pop
homelessness["indiv_per_10k"] = 10000 * homelessness['individuals'] / homelessness['state_pop'] 

# Subset rows for indiv_per_10k greater than 20
high_homelessness = homelessness[homelessness['indiv_per_10k'] > 20]

# Sort high_homelessness by descending indiv_per_10k
high_homelessness_srt = high_homelessness.sort_values('indiv_per_10k',ascending=False)

# From high_homelessness_srt, select the state and indiv_per_10k cols
result = high_homelessness_srt[['state', 'indiv_per_10k']]

# See the result
print(result)
